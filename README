This is zeromod, a modification of sauerbraten game server.
It is currently work-in-progress software and may lack some features you may want; see TODO.

Features:
	* Has server commands interface
	* Can reload configuration on-the-fly (via SIGUSR1)
	* Server administrators can execute commands in server side with #exec
	* Bots may be kept then changing maps (clearbots 0)
	* Game length and intermission length can be customized from config file
	* More privileges for auth system
	* Best stats (currently limited to fraging stats, no flags/skulls/bases)
	* Limited modules support (very limited, but has working geoip module)
	* Ability to increase game length by 50% in
		teammodes (teamplay, instateam, efficteam, capture & regen capture)
		as in older Justice version
	* Ability to change default gamespeed
	* masterpass & authpass for master and auth privileges
	* Password bruteforce protection
	* Colored privilege names
	* Protection from "disconnected because kicked/banned" messages
	* Muting players messages and editing
	* Spy

Some notable commands:
	* #pm (also possible to multipm with #pm 1,5,7 blablabla)
	* #stats (also avaiable #stats -1 to show stats of all players)
	* #exec (executes any cubescript)
	* #load (loads module from modules/ directory), #unload
	* #mute, #unmute, #editmute, #editunmute
	* #help
	* #priv (to set privilege of client)
	* #spy

Zeromod is written in same license as original server, zlib (look src/readme_source.txt for details).

Supported architectures are Linux and Windows, but I havent tested it in Windows yet.
